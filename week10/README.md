## UI Testing

> UI testing aims to test a "happy path" of how a user might interact with your application.

- UI testing allows us to simulate how a user might interact with
  our web page. We can simulate click events, typing, and can
  react to changes how a user might.

- UI tests are important because they cover what a user is most
  likely to notice.

**Getting started with Cypress**

- Cypress is a UI testing library. Begin by installing it by running:

`yarn add -D cypress`

- Run cypress with `yarn run cypress open` to open the test runner.

See demo `1.UI-testing`
