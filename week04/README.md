📦 Local Storage

## Local Storage

> Allows you to save data in the browser and have it persist across browser sessions.

```Javascript
// Data is stored as key/value pairs.
localStorage.setItem("[key]", "[value]");

// Set/get data:
localStorage.setItem("theme", "dark");
const theme = localStorage.getItem("theme"); //"dark"

// Delete items:
localStorage.removeItem("theme");

// Delete all items:
localStorage.clear();

```
