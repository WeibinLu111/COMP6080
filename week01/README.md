## Introduction to Frontend Programming

![HTML, CSS, JS](assets/image.png)

3 building blocks of frontend development:

1. **HTML** (HyperText Markup Language): defines the content and structure of a webpage.
2. **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets): used to add style to your HTML documents.
3. **JavaScript**: makes your webpage dynamic.

A web browser is a tool that processes HTML, CSS, JS (and more) and renders it for us to see.
